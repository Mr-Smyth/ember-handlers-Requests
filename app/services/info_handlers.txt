Handlers in this new architecture not only handle the request and response, 
but they can also be responsible for pushing data into the store 
(similar to how serializers did in the old architecture).

Ensure that your UserNormalizePushHandler is registered as an Ember service. 
This means you will create it as a service and then inject it where needed.
